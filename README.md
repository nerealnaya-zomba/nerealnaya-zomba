# Hey :ghost: :octocat: :octocat: :ghost:

I'm zombe, a passionate C++ developer. My objective is to become C++ expert, that can design and implement complex, secure yet fast cross-platform applications that use various network protocols. 

In future wanna try to develope libraries or make my own drivers for something. Also i wanna learn how to program microcontrollers. 

I love to learn new information.
